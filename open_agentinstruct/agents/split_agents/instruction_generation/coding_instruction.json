    "instruction": "Instruction:\nImplement a function in Python that finds the longest palindromic substring in a given string. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward.\n\nFunction Signature:\n```python\ndef longest_palindromic_substring(s: str) -> str:\n    # Your code here\n    pass\n```\n\nExample:\nInput: \"babad\"\nOutput: \"bab\" or \"aba\" (both are valid)\n\nInput: \"cbbd\"\nOutput: \"bb\"\n\nInput: \"a\"\nOutput: \"a\"\n\nProvide an efficient solution with explanations for your approach.",
    "answer": "Answer:\nHere's my implementation of the longest palindromic substring function:\n\n```python\ndef longest_palindromic_substring(s: str) -> str:\n    if not s:\n        return \"\"\n    \n    start = 0\n    max_length = 1\n    \n    # Helper function to expand around center\n    def expand_around_center(left, right):\n        while left >= 0 and right < len(s) and s[left] == s[right]:\n            left -= 1\n            right += 1\n        return left + 1, right - 1\n    \n    # Check each position as potential center\n    for i in range(len(s)):\n        # For odd length palindromes\n        left1, right1 = expand_around_center(i, i)\n        length1 = right1 - left1 + 1\n        \n        # For even length palindromes\n        left2, right2 = expand_around_center(i, i + 1)\n        length2 = right2 - left2 + 1\n        \n        # Update if we found a longer palindrome\n        if length1 > max_length:\n            max_length = length1\n            start = left1\n        if length2 > max_length:\n            max_length = length2\n            start = left2\n    \n    return s[start:start + max_length]\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. I'm using an efficient approach called \"expand around center\" which has O(nÂ²) time complexity and O(1) space complexity.\n\n2. For each position in the string, I check two cases:\n   - The character itself as the center of an odd-length palindrome\n   - The space between the current character and the next as the center of an even-length palindrome\n\n3. For each potential center, I expand outward as long as the characters match and we're within bounds.\n\n4. I keep track of the longest palindrome found by storing its starting position and length.\n\n5. This approach works well because:\n   - It checks all possible palindromes efficiently\n   - It handles both odd and even length palindromes\n   - It avoids unnecessary string manipulations\n   - It works with single-character strings and empty strings\n\nThe final solution returns the substring that represents the longest palindrome found in the input string."
