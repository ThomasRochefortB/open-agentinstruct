    "answer": "Answer:\n The trigonometric substitution method is a technique used to evaluate integrals that contain square roots of quadratic expressions. For the integral of the function \u221a(4x^2 - 1), we can use trigonometric substitution by choosing a trigonometric function that will simplify the square root when substituted into the integral.\n\nThe first step in the trigonometric substitution method is to identify the appropriate trigonometric substitution that will simplify the integrand. In this case, we have a square root of the form \u221a(a^2 - x^2), where a^2 = 4 and x^2 = x^2. This suggests using a substitution that involves the sine or cosine function, since sin^2(\u03b8) + cos^2(\u03b8) = 1.\n\nFor \u221a(4x^2 - 1), we can let x = (1/2)sec(\u03b8), where \u03b8 is the new variable of integration. This substitution is chosen because:\n\n1. When x = (1/2)sec(\u03b8), we have 4x^2 = sec^2(\u03b8), and\n2. sec^2(\u03b8) - 1 = tan^2(\u03b8), which is a trigonometric identity.\n\nSo, the substitution is:\n\nx = (1/2)sec(\u03b8)\n\nNow, we need to express dx in terms of d\u03b8 and also rewrite the square root in terms of \u03b8. Differentiating x with respect to \u03b8 gives us:\n\ndx = (1/2)sec(\u03b8)tan(\u03b8)d\u03b8\n\nSubstituting x into the square root gives us:\n\n\u221a(4x^2 - 1) = \u221a(sec^2(\u03b8) - 1) = \u221a(tan^2(\u03b8)) = |tan(\u03b8)|\n\nSince we are dealing with the positive square root, we can assume that \u03b8 is chosen such that tan(\u03b8) is positive, and thus we can drop the absolute value:\n\n\u221a(4x^2 - 1) = tan(\u03b8)\n\nNow, we can rewrite the integral in terms of \u03b8:\n\n\u222b\u221a(4x^2 - 1)dx = \u222btan(\u03b8) * (1/2)sec(\u03b8)tan(\u03b8)d\u03b8\n\nThis is the integral we need to solve after the trigonometric substitution. The next steps would involve integrating with respect to \u03b8, then using the inverse trigonometric function to go back to the variable x, and finally applying the limits of integration if they are given."
