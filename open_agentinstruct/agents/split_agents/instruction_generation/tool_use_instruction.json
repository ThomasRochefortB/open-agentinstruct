Calculator\n   - Description: Performs mathematical calculations\n   - Usage: calculator(expression)\n   - Example: calculator(\"23 * 4.5 - 7\")\n\n2. WeatherAPI\n   - Description: Gets current weather information for a location\n   - Usage: weather(location)\n   - Example: weather(\"New York\")\n\n3. UnitConverter\n   - Description: Converts between different units of measurement\n   - Usage: convert(value, from_unit, to_unit)\n   - Example: convert(\"5\", \"kilometers\", \"miles\")\n\nTask: A family is planning a road trip from Chicago to Miami, which is approximately 1,377 miles. Their car gets an average of 28 miles per gallon of gas. The current temperature in Miami is 10°C warmer than in Chicago, where it's currently 15°C. Calculate how many gallons of gas they'll need for the trip, and tell them what temperature (in Fahrenheit) to expect when they arrive in Miami.\n\nProvide your reasoning step by step and use the appropriate tools to solve this problem.",
    "answer": "Answer:\nI'll solve this problem step by step using the provided tools.\n\nStep 1: Calculate how many gallons of gas will be needed for the trip.\nI know the distance is 1,377 miles and the car gets 28 miles per gallon. To find the gallons needed, I'll divide the total distance by the miles per gallon.\n\n```\ncalculator(\"1377 / 28\")\n```\nResult: 49.17857142857143\n\nSo they'll need about 49.18 gallons of gas for the trip.\n\nStep 2: Find the current temperature in Chicago.\nThe problem states that it's currently 15°C in Chicago.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the temperature in Miami.\nMiami is 10°C warmer than Chicago, so:\n\n```\ncalculator(\"15 + 10\")\n```\nResult: 25\n\nSo the temperature in Miami is 25°C.\n\nStep 4: Convert the Miami temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit.\nI'll use the unit converter tool for this:\n\n```\nconvert(\"25\", \"celsius\", \"fahrenheit\")\n```\nResult: 77\n\nTherefore, the family will need approximately 49.18 gallons of gas for their trip from Chicago to Miami, and they should expect a temperature of 77°F when they arrive in Miami."
