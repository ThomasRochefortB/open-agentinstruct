      "instruction": "Instruction:\n You have a glass of water and a glass of wine, both containing equal amounts of liquid (100ml each). You take a teaspoon of wine from the wine glass and put it in the water glass. Then you take a teaspoon of the mixture from the water glass and put it back into the wine glass. Is there now more wine in the water glass or more water in the wine glass?",
      "answer": "Answer:\n There is exactly the same amount of wine in the water glass as there is water in the wine glass.\n\nLet's think through this step by step:\n\n1. Initially, we have 100ml of water in one glass and 100ml of wine in another glass.\n\n2. After taking a teaspoon (let's say 5ml) of wine and adding it to the water glass, we have:\n   - Water glass: 100ml water + 5ml wine = 105ml total (mixture)\n   - Wine glass: 95ml wine\n\n3. The water glass now contains a mixture that is 100/105 water and 5/105 wine.\n\n4. When we take a teaspoon (5ml) from this mixture and put it back into the wine glass, we're moving:\n   - (5/105) × 5ml = 0.24ml of wine back to the wine glass\n   - (100/105) × 5ml = 4.76ml of water to the wine glass\n\n5. Final state:\n   - Water glass: 100ml - 4.76ml = 95.24ml water and 5ml - 0.24ml = 4.76ml wine\n   - Wine glass: 95ml + 0.24ml = 95.24ml wine and 4.76ml water\n\nAs we can see, there is 4.76ml of wine in the water glass and 4.76ml of water in the wine glass. The amounts are exactly equal."
