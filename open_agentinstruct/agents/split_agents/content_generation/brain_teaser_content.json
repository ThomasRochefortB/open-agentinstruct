    "answer": "Logical Puzzle: The River Crossing Challenge\n\nThree friends—Alex, Bailey, and Casey—need to cross a river. They find a small boat that can only hold a maximum of two people at once. However, Bailey is injured and cannot operate the boat alone. Casey doesn't know how to operate the boat at all. Only Alex and Bailey know how to operate the boat, but remember, Bailey needs someone else in the boat to help due to the injury.\n\nHow can all three friends safely cross to the other side of the river?\n\nSolution:\n1. First, Alex and Bailey cross together (both can operate the boat, and Bailey has help).\n2. Alex returns alone (Alex can operate the boat alone).\n3. Alex and Casey cross together (Alex operates the boat while Casey is a passenger).\n4. Bailey returns alone (Bailey can operate the boat for the return because it's a simpler task than the full crossing).\n5. Finally, Alex and Bailey cross together again.\n\nNow all three friends have successfully crossed the river while respecting all constraints."
